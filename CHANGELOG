libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

## Changelog ##

Version 1.2 Release
-------------------
Modified the examples (b64enc, b64dec, encoder and decoder):
Added code to force STDIN and STDOUT to binary mode, since there
are operating systems out there where this is not the default mode
for these streams.

Added another example, called base64, which encodes and decodes 
depending on its arguments.

Created a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express 2010
edition, which simply builds the base64 example as a console application.

Version 1.1 Release
-------------------
Modified encode.h to (correctly) read from the iostream argument,
instead of std::cin.
Thanks to Peter K. Lee for the heads-up.

No API changes.

Version 1.0 Release
-------------------
The current content is the changeset.
