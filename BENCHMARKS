-- Intro

Some people have expressed opinions about how
fast libb64's encoding and decoding routines
are, as compared to some other base64 packages
out there.

This was a short and sweet benchmark, which takes
a large-ish file and encodes/decodes it a number
of times. The winner is the executable that does this
the quickest.

-- Packages

libb64-1.2 (libb64-base64)
From libb64.sourceforge.net
Size: 18808 bytes
Compiled with:
	CFLAGS += -O3
	BUFFERSIZE = 16777216

base64-1.5 (fourmilab-base64)
From http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/
Size: 20261 bytes
Compiled with Default package settings

coreutils 7.4-2ubuntu2 (coreutils-base64)
From http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
Size: 38488 bytes
Default binary distributed with Ubuntu 10.4

-- Input File

Using blender-2.49b-linux-glibc236-py25-i386.tar.bz2
from http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/
Size: 18285329 bytes
(approx. 18MB)

-- Method

Encode and Decode the Input file 50 times in a loop,
and get the running time.

-- Results

$ time ./benchmark-libb64.sh 
real	0m28.389s
user	0m14.077s
sys	0m12.309s

$ time ./benchmark-fourmilab.sh 
real	1m43.160s
user	1m23.769s
sys	0m8.737s

$ time ./benchmark-coreutils.sh 
real	0m36.288s
user	0m24.746s
sys	0m8.181s

-- Conclusion

libb64 is the fastest encoder/decoder, and 
has the smallest executable size.
